## Satellite Recovery Spaceplane (SRS):

We are the **SRS Design Team**, a team made up of around 20 undergraduate students at **Virginia Tech**.
Our mission, is to design (not implement) a [**spaceplane**](/articles/2016/03/29/What-is-a-Spaceplane), which will be able to reach heights of
around 200km (125 miles), in order to recover satellites prior to their decay in Earth's atmosphere.

Today, over [500,000 satellites orbit Earth](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/news/orbital_debris.html),
with that number growing more and more each year. Solutions have been purposed to solve this space pollution,
almost all of which involve the destruction of the satellites in orbit. Our goal is to seek out satellites of
interest, and recover them safely back to Earth, where their parts, software, and information can be used again.
This will potentially reduce the costs of building satellites, or prevent unwanted eyes from exploiting old security
measures in software to intercept data. The possibilities are unimaginable.

In order to reach this goal, and allow multiple missions to be executed at a reasonable expense, our team is looking
into the possibilities of developing a spaceplane that is reusable, and can fly to our desired altitude, unmanned.
A spaceplane is a vehicle which can fly in Earth's atmosphere, as well as in space. We believe that this is the future
for low earth orbital travel, and with advances in technologies like **Scramjet** and **Ramjet** technologies, we believe that
our mission is feasible.
